Supervised feature selection for safety climate - Indonesia Construction

The 6-models trained with supervised classifiers alogirthms. These are: 
  1. Random Forest
  2. Bagging
  3. AdaBoost
  4. SVM
  5. Gaussian Naive Bayesian
  6. KNN 

There are total 5-safety classes. 

Feature selection executed with three search strategies (FSS, BSS and GA) and in three rounds to select best 14, 11 and 6 features from original 22 features. 
The best results are generated by KNN and GNB. All results are presented in the "model_results.xlsx" file.
